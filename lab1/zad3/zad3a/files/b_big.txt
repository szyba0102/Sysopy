Wpatrzony w białe snopy światła
Późną nocą pod prąd
Bo jeśli to ostatni rejs (ta)
Mijam ostatni promień słońca
Wiesz, że tak bardzo lubię dzień
Gdy ciebie nie ma tracę sens
Proszę, dowiedz się
Czemu jest mi tutaj aż tak źle?
Krzywdzisz mnie już mniej
Nocą łatwiej mi to przyznać jest
Wpatrzony w mijające auta
Tempomaty, pasy, bieg
Historii zasępionych głów, (ta)
Czy ktoś zapamięta mnie
Jeśli dzisiaj zniknę?
Odnajdę swój pas, tempomat, bieg
Proszę, dowiedz się
Czemu jest mi tutaj aż tak źle?
Krzywdzisz mnie już mniej
Nocą łatwiej mi to przyznać jest
Proszę, dowiedz się
Czemu jest mi tutaj aż tak źle?
Krzywdzisz mnie już mniej
Nocą łatwiej mi to przyznać jest
Proszę, dowiedz się
Czemu jest mi tutaj aż tak źle?
Krzywdzisz mnie już mniej
Nocą łatwiej mi to przyznać jest
Czemu jest mi tu źle?
Czemu jest mi tu źle?
